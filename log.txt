***The Last Twenty Tweets***
"Duuuuuun.....duuuun....DUN DUN....dun dun dun dun......duuuuuun.....duuuuun......DUUUN DUUUN...DUN DUN DUN.....DUN. DUN"
"Since I now have twitter"
"I hate that I have a twitter"
"I die a little with each tweet"
"So here are the lyrics to the theme song from The Fresh Prince"
"And Will Smith is a hero of mine"
"Now this is a story all about how. My life got flipped turned upside down."
"And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there. I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air."
"In West Philadelphia born and raised. On the playground is where I spent most of my days."
"Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool. And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school."
"I got in one little fight and my mom got scared. And said \"You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air\""
"When a couple of guys who were up to no good. Started making trouble in my neighborhood."
"I begged and pleaded with her day after day. But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way."
"She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket. I put my Walkman on and said \"I might as well kick it\""
"First class, yo, this is bad. Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass."
"But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that. Is this the type of place that they should sent this cool cat?"
"I don't think so, I'll see when I get there. I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air"
"The end."
"Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmmm, this might be all right."
"Will Smith is my hero"
